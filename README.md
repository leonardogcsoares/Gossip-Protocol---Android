# Gossip-Protocol---Android
My implementation of the Gossip protocol using 12 simulated peers on an Android device. Serves merely as a point of understanding for using Bimodal Multicast in a broadcasting application.

Dissiminations simulates that the peer has a 1% chance to receive the new message, does not consider that the more peers that have the message, the more the new message will be broadcasted.
